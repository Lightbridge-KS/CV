## Material

|     This CV document is in `R Markdown` format created by [`vitae`](https://pkg.mitchelloharawild.com/vitae/index.html) R package. Most of the data in this CV comes from my private Google Sheet.

-   [`googlesheets4::read_sheet()`](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/reference/range_read.html) was used to read data from the Google Sheet in to `R`,

-   Then, I've passed that data to [`vitae::detailed_entries()`](https://pkg.mitchelloharawild.com/vitae/reference/cv_entries.html) which automagically create LaTeX code as PDF nicely.

|     The benefit of "data-driven" CV is not much because I did not have many data to feed into it. However, creation process of this CV is fun enough to play with.
